    <h2>What is Cybersecurity?</h2>
    <p>Cybersecurity is the practice of safeguarding computers, servers, networks, and data from malicious attacks. As the digital world grows, cybersecurity becomes crucial for preventing unauthorized access, theft, or damage to information systems. Cybersecurity is not just important for businesses; itâ€™s equally essential for individuals, governments, and society as a whole.</p>
    
    <h2>Why Cybersecurity Matters in Today's World</h2>
    <p>The digital transformation has brought incredible convenience, but it also increases the risk of cyber threats. Whether it's securing online transactions, protecting sensitive data, or ensuring that critical infrastructure runs smoothly, cybersecurity plays a vital role. Strong cybersecurity measures prevent threats like data breaches, financial losses, and even reputational damage.</p>
    
    <h2>Common Cybersecurity Threats</h2>
    <p>Cyber threats come in many forms. Here are some common types:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Malware:</strong> Malicious software, like viruses and spyware, that infects and damages systems.</li>
        <li><strong>Phishing:</strong> Fraudulent messages tricking people into revealing sensitive information.</li>
        <li><strong>Ransomware:</strong> Malware that encrypts files and demands a ransom for their release.</li>
        <li><strong>Denial of Service (DoS) Attacks:</strong> Overloading systems to disrupt access and services.</li>
        <li><strong>Man-in-the-Middle (MITM) Attacks:</strong> Eavesdropping attacks that intercept communications between two parties.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Principles of Cybersecurity</h2>
    <p>Cybersecurity is built upon three core principles, often called the CIA Triad:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Confidentiality:</strong> Ensuring data is accessible only to those authorized to see it.</li>
        <li><strong>Integrity:</strong> Protecting data from being altered by unauthorized users.</li>
        <li><strong>Availability:</strong> Ensuring authorized users have access to data and resources when needed.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>How to Protect Yourself Online</h2>
    <p>Adopting good security habits is essential for personal and professional safety. Here are some basic practices:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Use strong, unique passwords for each account and update them regularly.</li>
        <li>Enable two-factor authentication (2FA) whenever possible for an extra layer of protection.</li>
        <li>Be cautious when clicking links or downloading attachments from unknown sources.</li>
        <li>Regularly update software and applications to fix security vulnerabilities.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Future of Cybersecurity</h2>
    <p>As technology evolves, so do cyber threats. Innovations like Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Machine Learning (ML) are playing an increasing role in identifying and preventing cyberattacks. Additionally, the rise of Internet of Things (IoT) devices and cloud computing brings new challenges and emphasizes the need for advanced cybersecurity strategies.</p>
